                        The offer from the mayor was just what Ted Leonsis had
                        been looking for. For months, the billionaire owner of
                        the Washington Wizards and Capitals had been pressing
                        the D.C. government to pay at least half the cost of
                        modernizing his aging downtown arena. Now, in an email
                        on Dec. 10, a Sunday afternoon, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser
                        was offering just that — $500 million toward an $800
                        million project to keep his basketball and hockey teams
                        playing in the city for decades to come.

                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        Leonsis responded two hours later, saying he would
                        review the proposal right away and suggesting they meet.
                        On Tuesday morning, the mayor presented her offer at
                        Leonsis’s corporate offices at Capital One Arena, in a
                        conference room with windows overlooking the street
                        below. They spoke for an hour before the Democratic
                        mayor brought up the elephant in the room. She said she
                        had heard chatter that Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn
                        Youngkin was about to announce a deal to build an arena
                        for the teams on the other side of the Potomac River.
                        She asked Leonsis if it was true.

                        Leonsis spun 360 degrees in his chair. Nothing had been
                        signed, he said, but he acknowledged he would be joining
                        Youngkin for an announcement the next day. Suddenly, it
                        became clear: He hadn’t invited the mayor to his offices
                        to discuss her offer. He’d done it to tell her she was
                        too late. “If you would have offered this to me
                        earlier,” he said, “I would have accepted it.” Leonsis’s
                        decision to pull his teams out of the city represents a
                        consequential rupture in what has been a successful
                        partnership between a three-term mayor and an owner who
                        had invested in the District for more than two decades
                        and pledged to stay there. If local and state officials
                        in Virginia sign off, the move could also stall an
                        economic engine that has drawn more than 2 million
                        visitors per year to Chinatown, an area that has lately
                        struggled with empty storefronts, office vacancies and
                        crime.

                        The construction of a sports and entertainment complex
                        at the site Leonsis has chosen in Alexandria would
                        further shift wealth and spending to the prosperous
                        Northern Virginia suburbs. It would be a legacy-defining
                        coup for a Republican governor who has flirted with
                        running for president.

                        The District faced competition from Virginia only
                        because Leonsis had begun quietly exploring a new home
                        for his teams in 2022, after years of complaining about
                        crime and the noise of buskers outside his arena. He had
                        come to believe the mayor was more interested in other
                        professional sports teams, particularly the Commanders,
                        whom Bowser was courting to return to the District.

                        dragged on for over a year, leaving the owner
                        frustrated.

                        In her negotiations to keep the Wizards and the Capitals
                        from leaving, the mayor was hobbled by the city’s
                        self-imposed limit on borrowing, which prevented her
                        from offering the money Leonsis said he needed upfront.
                        Not until six days before the meeting at his corporate
                        offices did a major financial transaction allow her to
                        offer hundreds of millions of dollars more upfront.

                        them spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe
                        sensitive conversations. The Washington Post also
                        obtained emails and planning and financial documents

                        wasn’t even about money, he claimed. “This was about the
                        future,” he said, and the chance to build something
                        special on a bigger plot of land. “We can continue to

                        said. “He wants a bigger uplift for his investment than
                        he could get in Washington. And he should be honest

                        The agreement between Leonsis and Youngkin is not a done

                        Assembly and the Alexandria City Council, which together
                        must approve borrowing nearly $1.5 billion — and kick in
                        more than $300 million for transportation, a parking
                        facility and concert hall. A powerful Senate Democrat
                        has objected to Youngkin’s plan, Alexandria residents
                        have raised traffic concerns, and Bowser has sparred
                        with Monumental over whether Leonsis’s lease requires
                        that the teams remain in the building until 2047.

                        The District government offered five acres between Sixth
                        and Seventh streets NW for the project, but the city’s
                        finances were in ruins. If Pollin wanted his arena, he
                        would have to build the $220 million project himself —
                        and he did, borrowing heavily to do it. D.C. provided a
                        below-market land lease and tax benefits that helped pay
                        part of the debt over time. The 20,674-seat venue opened
                        as MCI Center in 1997.

                        Two years later, Pollin sold majority control of the
                        Capitals to Leonsis, a grandson of Greek immigrants who
                        became the first in his family to graduate from college
                        when he got his degree from Georgetown University.
                        Leonsis founded a software-catalogue business and sold
                        it at age 27, walking away with $20 million, and later
                        became a senior executive at the early internet giant
                        AOL.

                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        After Pollin died in 2009, Leonsis added a majority
                        stake in the Wizards and the arena. Chinatown was
                        booming, and Pollin was being credited for making it
                        happen. Law firms were moving in, retailers were
                        competing for storefronts and the sidewalks were teeming
                        with visitors. D.C. renamed the block of F Street NW
                        next to the arena Abe Pollin Way.

                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        Along with the arena, Leonsis acquired Pollin’s mortgage
                        — something he has often referred to as “the worst
                        building deal in professional sports.” The Washington
                        Nationals play in a baseball stadium that was almost
                        completely paid for by the District. By contrast,
                        Leonsis pays around $21 million annually on a mortgage,
                        according to Monumental.

                        build a $65 million, 4,200-seat facility in Southeast
                        Washington where the Wizards would practice and two
                        other Leonsis basketball teams, the Washington Mystics
                        and Capital City Go-Go, would play home games. The
                        District paid more than 90 percent of the cost, and
                        Monumental brought fans to one of the poorest parts of
                        the city.

                        At a news conference announcing the deal, Leonsis gave
                        the new mayor a peck on the cheek. “I think we have the
                        most dynamic and accomplished mayor of any major city in
                        our country,” he said. Bowser smiled and bowed. They
                        both wanted a long-term pact to keep his NBA and NHL
                        teams downtown.

                        Bowser was well aware of the price that was paid when
                        then-D.C. Mayor Sharon Pratt failed to reach a stadium
                        deal with Jack Kent Cooke, the owner of Washington’s NFL
                        franchise, in the early 1990s. Cooke moved his team to
                        Maryland, and Pratt lost her reelection bid after one
                        term.

                        Leonsis often spoke of the “double bottom line” of doing
                        good while doing well. He revitalized the Capitals by
                        drafting stars such as Alexander Ovechkin, turning the
                        team into a source of civic pride as it repeatedly won
                        division titles and eventually the Stanley Cup. He made
                        charitable contributions and invested in and around his
                        arena, then called Verizon Center.

                        As time went on, though, Leonsis chafed at what he
                        viewed as city officials’ lack of urgency in addressing
                        conditions around the arena. Buskers and street
                        musicians — sometimes with full drum sets and amplifiers
                        — were so loud below Leonsis’s office at the arena that
                        he covered windows with thick wooden shelving.

                        complaints from downtown residents and business owners.
                        The measure went nowhere in the face of opposition from
                        street musicians and activists who said it would stifle
                        cultural expression. Council members introduced the bill

                        in June 2020, she heard from Monumental representatives
                        almost immediately. They complained about crime around
                        the arena, regulations affecting the business and the

                        “Their displeasure with some of what was going on in the
                        city was very clear, and they made that known in all of
                        my meetings with them,” Pinto said. In 2021, Pinto
                        co-sponsored the council’s third attempt at anti-noise
                        legislation. Again, it failed to pass.

                        Besides the noise, Leonsis was concerned about public
                        safety and the vacancies that spread as office workers
                        remained home following the worst of the covid-19
                        pandemic. “Covid changed the world in every city,” said
                        Raul Fernandez, one of Monumental’s minority owners and
                        a friend of Leonsis’s since their AOL days. “Some cities
                        handled it better than others, and some handled being on
                        the other side of covid better than others.”

                        violence, drug use, homelessness and struggling
                        businesses around the arena and the practice facility in

                        club-level seating lagged behind competitors and needed
                        to be updated. In March 2022, company representatives
                        and Falcicchio had begun analyzing three possibilities:
                        a $355 million partial renovation, an $820 million full
                        renovation and a $1.5 billion newly built arena.
                        Monumental decided to pursue the full renovation, in
                        part because it could yield more “high value” seats that
                        were closer to the floor and a range of new luxury and
                        premium suites to maximize ticket revenue.

                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        The discussions were progressing enough that Monumental
                        continued to invest in and around what had been renamed
                        Capital One Arena. In 2022, it completed $125 million in
                        upgrades from the previous decade and prepared to begin
                        spending another $85 million.

                        In December, Leonsis celebrated the anniversary with a

                        behind the scenes, as the mayor began her third term and
                        declared reviving downtown a top priority, Leonsis had
                        started to look outside the city. His staff sent
                        criteria for a new arena location to economic
                        development officials in Virginia, who began looking for
                        possible sites on the company’s behalf.

                        On Dec. 30, 2022, a state economic development official
                        in Richmond sent emails to several localities in
                        Northern Virginia. They were looking for potential
                        sports arena sites for a “highly confidential prospect.”
                        The secret endeavor had a code name, the emails said:
                        “Project Potter.” The emails laid out Monumental’s
                        requirements: 10-12 acres for the arena, an additional
                        5-16 acres for parking, 5-17 acres for training
                        facilities and 10-75 acres for a “mixed-use complex
                        (commercial, residential, entertainment).”

                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        Another desire was “a community that would welcome the
                        engagement of approximately 2.5M+ people annually
                        through games, concerts and events.” Virginia officials
                        came back to Leonsis with a few potential sites outside
                        the Beltway. Monumental also had preliminary talks with
                        Maryland officials, who floated the idea of a new arena
                        near the teams’ previous home, in Landover, according to
                        Monumental. The company wasn’t interested.

                        But Leonsis wasn’t happy in the District, either. He
                        felt his teams were not a top priority for the mayor and
                        her staff, who had been working to woo the Washington
                        Commanders from Maryland to their old home on the
                        Anacostia River. “I started hearing, ‘Well we want to
                        bring the football team back,’” he said. The city’s
                        baseball stadium needed repairs as well, he added. “They
                        had to make investments. I go, ‘I don’t have a high
                        level of confidence that I’m at the top of the stack.’”

                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        During a Capitals game last year, he griped in the
                        owner’s box that despite what he contributed to the
                        city, its leadership seemed to care more for other
                        teams, and he “couldn’t even get a fruit basket.” The
                        mayor’s office got word. Her staff sent him a gift box
                        with a candle and coasters adorned with D.C. logos.

                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        Monumental made little progress that spring in talks
                        with D.C. officials, particularly after Falcicchio, the
                        company’s point person in the mayor’s office, resigned
                        in March after he was accused of sexual harassment.
                        Later that month, Leonsis met with Bowser and, according
                        to Monumental, told her he was reviewing an option
                        across the Potomac. “You don’t want to go to Virginia,”
                        she said twice, according to notes taken by two
                        executives present for that meeting and described to The
                        Post. In an interview, Bowser said she did not remember
                        Leonsis raising Virginia, adding, “I took Virginia
                        seriously the whole time.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        In April, JBG Smith representatives gave Leonsis his
                        first look at the land. They took him up to the roof of
                        an office building overlooking the 70-acre site, a
                        combination of vacant lots, parking and a shopping plaza
                        anchored by a Target. From there he could see the
                        Potomac River, Reagan National Airport, even Capital One
                        Arena.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        “When this coalesced to me was when I went out and
                        climbed on the roof,” Leonsis said. He could envision
                        how he could bring all of his facilities together into
                        one hub. “You go jeez, it’s like, there’s water. I love
                        being on the water. Jeez there’s the airport. I really
                        like to fly out of there. And we can put a hotel and an
                        office building here. Right now we’re in five different
                        places,” he said. “Visiting teams could fly in and be at
                        the hotel and be eating here. Boy, the leagues would
                        love that. The teams would love that.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        With the potentially viable option at Potomac Yard,
                        Leonsis made his first concrete request of the District.
                        On June 7, Monumental asked for $600 million toward an
                        $800 million renovation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        Leonsis and Bowser agreed on a Sept. 1 deadline to come
                        to terms. That timeline also opened a window for
                        Virginia. In the following weeks, economic development
                        officials from the state and the city of Alexandria kept
                        up regular calls with Monumental to see whether they
                        could sketch out a deal. Later in June, Alexandria Mayor
                        Justin M. Wilson (D) met with Kelly and other JBG Smith
                        executives in the developer’s marketing center, where a
                        built-to-scale model showed the neighborhood’s
                        potential.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        Kelly also invited Sen. Mark R. Warner (D), a JBG Smith
                        investor and longtime acquaintance of Leonsis’s, to come
                        look at their plan. Warner was impressed. “My immediate
                        concern was where is the governor going to be on this,
                        where is the community going to be,” he said in an
                        interview.

                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        Youngkin, 57, a former basketball player at Rice
                        University, had risen to the top of the investment giant
                        Carlyle Group, becoming co-chief executive in 2018
                        before running for governor in 2021. He and Leonsis had
                        met before Youngkin entered politics, traveling in
                        similar social circles in the ultrawealthy
                        Washington-area business class. They spoke about the
                        project for the first time in June. “I was skeptical
                        simply for lots of, lots of reasons,” Youngkin said.
                        “But I was also incredibly intrigued because of the
                        uniqueness of this, and we really began to assess the
                        opportunity of two teams moving at one time.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        The two men met in person on July 21 in the same Falls
                        Church office complex that houses Youngkin’s political
                        action committee. Rather than gather in the PAC’s
                        windowless conference room, Youngkin invited Leonsis to
                        the 14th-floor offices of a private business where they
                        could enjoy expansive views — and meet in secret.
                        Leonsis described his vision for a sports and
                        entertainment district at Potomac Yard. The governor —
                        taking notes, as he often had when sizing up deals for
                        Carlyle — laid out his priorities: He would not support
                        broad new taxes on Virginians or give public money
                        directly to the company as an incentive. He wanted
                        Alexandria and the commonwealth to see economic
                        benefits. He wanted to build something special.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        “That meeting was an important one,” Youngkin said. “And
                        it was a place where we were able to construct a shared
                        vision about where we might be able to go.”
                    </p>

                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        But by Sept. 1, it seemed like Youngkin might be out of
                        luck. Bowser and Leonsis broadly agreed to proceed on
                        the $800 million renovation. Bowser countered Leonsis’s
                        $600 million request with $432 million — a nearly 50-50
                        split. Leonsis was amenable.

                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        “The mayor and I went back and forth and it’s like, all
                        right, let’s split it,” he said. “Let’s be partners.”
                        They arranged to meet less than a week later, Sept. 7,
                        in the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. The mayor
                        and her team, with D.C. Chief Financial Officer Glen Lee
                        in attendance, made their pitch with a 30-page slide
                        deck. Going into the meeting, Monumental staff expected
                        the city to propose providing its share of the project
                        cost upfront. Instead, Bowser called for Monumental to
                        front the full cost of the project and for the District
                        government to pay back its share over six to 10 years.
                        City officials promised the $432 million would come from
                        a new tax on properties within a two-mile radius of the
                        arena. Bowser also offered to invest tens of millions of
                        dollars to build housing and stabilize the Metro system.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        The city’s aim was to make Leonsis a partner in a
                        rebirth of downtown much in the way the arena did when
                        it opened under Pollin. But Leonsis didn’t want to take
                        the risk Pollin had by borrowing all the money upfront
                        with the assurance that the city would pay off its share
                        later. In the meeting, Leonsis raised concerns about
                        crime around the arena, but the money was his primary
                        focus. He said he didn’t like the idea of a tax that
                        would take money out of other business owners’ pockets,
                        and he didn’t want to have to rely on future District
                        leaders to follow through on Bowser’s promises. He told
                        the mayor he needed the city’s contribution upfront.

                    <p class="bodyparagraph">
                        During the previous two decades, the District government
                        had injected hundreds of millions of dollars into
                        economic development projects that remade the city:
                        Nationals Park, the convention center hotel, the Yards
                        development in Southeast, the Wharf in Southwest. But
                        Leonsis had shown up when the spigot was running dry.
                        Under a law the D.C. Council passed more than a decade
                        ago to safeguard the city’s finances and improve its
                        bond ratings, payments toward debt have to stay beneath
                        12 percent of total spending. There was nowhere near
                        enough capacity for the District to borrow $800 million,
                        or even $400 million, without violating that 12 percent
                        cap.

                        said. “So we didn’t have the ability to borrow.”
                        Bowser’s proposed new tax on downtown properties was an
                        attempt at a workaround, but Leonsis wouldn’t go for it.

                        The offer from the mayor was just what Ted Leonsis had
                        been looking for. For months, the billionaire owner of
                        the Washington Wizards and Capitals had been pressing
                        the D.C. government to pay at least half the cost of
                        modernizing his aging downtown arena. Now, in an email
                        on Dec. 10, a Sunday afternoon, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser
                        was offering just that — $500 million toward an $800
                        million project to keep his basketball and hockey teams
                        playing in the city for decades to come.
